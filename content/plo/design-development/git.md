In the instructional design course (EDTECH 503), I developed a training that introduced new employees to the installation, configuration, and basic use of a collaborative software engineering tool called [git](https://git-scm.com/) and its companion [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).  This was very applicable personally as I was struggling with the use of the tool in my new position as a test engineer. This section of the completed ID project provided a hypothetical trainer at the company with the rationale of the proposed intervention as well as tables that articulate the learning objectives and activities. The development portion of the artifact provides learning materials as well as guidelines for the assessments to be completed by the learners. Finally, the implementation section provides a detailed description of how to deliver the intervention to new test engineers.

This artifact connects well to the design and development PLO while also being clearly connected to my professional practice.  I have to confess that as I review this training now after working with git and GitLab everyday for the past several months there are a lot of modifications that should be made.  However, I am still convinced something like this should be part of the onboarding process at my workplace.
