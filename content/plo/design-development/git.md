In the instructional design course (EDTECH 503), I developed an introduction to the installation, configuration, and basic use of a collaborative software engineering tool called git.  This was very applicable personally as I was struggling with the use of the tool in my new position as a test engineer. This section of the completed ID project provided a hypothetical trainer at the company I work at with the rationale of the proposed intervention as well as tables that articulate the learning objectives and activities. The development portion of the artifact provides learning materials as well as guidelines for the assessments to be completed by the learners. Finally, the implementation section provides a detailed description of how to deliver the intervention to new test engineers.
