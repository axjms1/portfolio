This artifact is another website developed by hand using the bootstrap framework.  This website is very similar to the previous artifact but I was able to experiment a little more with the css and develop tables and columns in the website layouts. 

Like the previous artifact the content of this website has little to do with my professional practice. Meticulous coding is a part of my work however and while developing websites by hand even subtle difference require a significant amount of time. This website shows how I was starting to develop a personal bootstrap template for websites to make the website development process more efficient. Fortunately, web design is not a significant part of my work.
