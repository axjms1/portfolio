I took EDTECH 512: Online Course Design before I took EDTECH 503: Instructional Design so it was a rapid introduction to the concept of instructional design, an entire field of study I had no prior exposure to.  The structure provided by the template in the course was very helpful in giving a framework to build the online course around. This artifact provides the design I used to develop the [Beginning Python Course](https://edtech2.boisestate.edu/jasonsandidge/512/start.html) in EDTECH 512 which will be featured elsewhere in this portfolio.

This design document clearly articulates the plan that I followed in developing the online course and provides the rationale behind the design.  From front-end analysis to formative evaluation this design drove the development of the course. This was one of the first points of the program when I learned how instructional design provides the map for course development.
