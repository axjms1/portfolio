The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative [(CITI)](https://about.citiprogram.org/) provides research ethics training to the research community. I completed this course as part of an independent study for EDTECH 596. The project was focused on assisting Dr. Hung with the development of a machine learning model that could predict at-risk BSU students.  Unfortunately, delays in the approval of the project by the Institutional Review Board stymied the progress of the study. I hope to work on the project in the fall.

The training was an excellent introduction to the basics of information security, health privacy, and [FERPA](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/what-ferpa).
