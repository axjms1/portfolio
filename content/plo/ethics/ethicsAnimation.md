The animation in this artifact lacks sophistication but illustrates a common ethical challenge in my former job as an IT administrator at a small charter school.  Greater autonomy is a wonderful feature of charter schools but that autonomy should not be used to compromise ethical standards or violate school policy.  In this animation, I examine how the temptation to violate technology purchasing policies for friends at work can quickly lead to ethics violations.
