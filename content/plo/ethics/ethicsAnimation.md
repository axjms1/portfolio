The animation in this artifact lacks sophistication but illustrates a common ethical challenge in my former job as an IT administrator at a small charter school.  Greater autonomy is a wonderful feature of charter schools but that autonomy should not be used to compromise ethical standards or violate school policy.  In this animation, which was created using [Powtoon](https://www.powtoon.com), I examine how the temptation to violate technology purchasing policies for friends at work can quickly lead to ethics violations.

The ethical challenge in this animation is less relevant to me in current profession but in my previous work it was something I was forced to deal with surprisingly often.  It is natural to become friends with the people you work with but it is important not to let those friendships compromise your professional ethics.  That lesson should inform everyone's professional practice.
