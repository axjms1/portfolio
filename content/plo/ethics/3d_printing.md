This is the final non reactive website I created in EDTECH 502. At this point in the course I was starting to chafe against the limitations of basic html/css websites.  Of course, there is a much higher ceiling than what I accomplished here but I knew there were more modern ways to build dynamic and reactive websites and was anxious to learn more about them.

The content of this website is focused on the unique challenges 3D printing poses regarding intellectual property law and fair use. 3D printers are becoming more and more common in schools and we had several at the time that faculty and students could experiment with. Ensuring our school was using the printers legally while recognizing the latitude that Fair Use provided was my responsibility as the IT Administrator. I enjoyed learning about the differences between trademark, copyright, and patent.  Which are three very different concepts that are often conflated.
