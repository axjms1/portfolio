This artifact is one of the first websites I developed in EDTECH 502 which should be clear by its brevity and simplicity. The content is based on a simple mnemonic I came up with to describe some netiquette guidelines, or how to behave online. As an IT administrator in a school this is one topic I did spend time on educating both students and faculty.  These guidelines have a strong cybersecurity slant because it was something I had to deal with on a daily basis.  Unfortunately dealing with online bullying was another challenge as an IT administrator and the "Be Sociable" guideline was a small attempt to address that vexing issue.
