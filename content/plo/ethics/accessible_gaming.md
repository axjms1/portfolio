The Accessible Gaming website was developed in EDTECH 502 and focused on two things I value highly: accessability and gaming. Everyone should be able to share in the same fun activities many of us take for granted. The online charter school I used to work for had a large percentage of children with special needs.  There was an even higher percentage of kids who enjoyed video games.  I am reasonably sure the percentage approached 100% regarding that statistic!  The research I did for this website helped me identify controllers that we could purchase for the video game club that made this social and fun activity more accessible and inclusive for our student population.
