The artifact featured below is the final project for EDTECH 538 and features all of the work completed in that course. It should look familiar because it is based on the same framework and uses the same tools that I used to develop this portfolio. I chose to feature this artifact in leadership because I feel it demonstrates personal innovation in web development and I wanted to discuss the process behind the creation of this artifact as well as my final portfolio. Although I do not work in front-end development professionally the skills learned building this portfolio would lend well to that pursuit and contribute to my professional portfolio in the future. Listed below are a few of the tools used to build the Maker Portfolio and this one.

- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/): Most of the site is written in markdown format.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Was used to write and organize all of the pages.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): Is a static site generator and is used to render the files into html and css which are browser readable.
- [Paige](https://willfaught.com/paige/): Is the theme that provides the look and feel for the website.  Will Faught is the developer and has personally helped me configure and deploy this website as well as squash bugs we found together.  I would like to personally acknowledge and thank him.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/): Is used to track changes as well as recover from mistakes.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): Hosts the website as well as the repository that it is built from. It is a free alternative to GitLab.

Initially, I developed these portfolios locally with the hope of simply dropping them onto the BSU server via FTP but that was a mistake. Once I completely committed to git/GitHub and fully invested in implementing the automated workflows the project really came together.  The actual repository for the maker portfolio can be viewed [here](https://github.com/axjms1/maker_portfolio). To update the portfolio I simply need to enter three basic commands.

{{< paige/code >}}
git add .
git commit -m "I updated ..."
git push origin main
{{< /paige/code >}}
