I developed this online course as the final project in EDTECH 512. This course intends to introduce learners to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and the core concepts of computational thinking. While this artifact does not demonstrate leadership from its content alone the method I chose to implement the artifact hopefully does.

This course represents a significant amount of time and effort although I am not sure that it is readily apparent by its appearance. EDTECH 512 should have been challenging enough with the introduction of instructional design and evaluation but I wanted to increase my knowledge regarding both the specific topic of Python and web development in general. Because of those overarching personal goals I elected to develop the course by hand and forgo the use of an LMS such as [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) and all the conveniences that system provides. All assessments were coded using JavaScript to make them reactive and I was able to embed a Python interpreter from [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/python3/a0f35632ed) so that learners could code directly within the course. Ironically, the JavaScript in the website was such a struggle I am not sure that I learned anything new about Python!
