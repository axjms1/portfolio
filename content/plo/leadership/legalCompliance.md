Leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for their organization and legal compliance is an important component of this.  This artifact was developed in EDTECH 501 to leverage technology and help school leaders ensure their online presence meets all applicable legal requirements.  This can be a complicated task, especially in a small charter school setting with limited resources and expertise.  This self-assessment can be completed by school or IT administrators to identify all essential components of a website regarding compliance including legal disclosures and policies at the time it was published.

When I developed this artifact the legal compliance of school websites was a constant struggle with changing demands and threats of auditor citations.  This project was an attempt to get ahead of that and ensure the website I was maintaining was legally compliant.  I had hopes at the time of developing an automated tool that could scrape school websites and generate a report with areas of concern but before I had a chance to pursue that further I had transitioned to another career.
