In this artifact I compared and contrasted two online courses that covered similar topics to the course I was developing in EDTECH 512, Beginning Python. The [Quality Matters](https://www.qualitymatters.org/) and the [OSCQR](https://oscqr.suny.edu/) standards provided a formal structure to assess each course and simultaneously informed me how I should attempt to design my instructional unit in the course. This was helpful in articulating what I should aim for in the course I was developing.

This artifact is a good example of how some formal rubrics can be so expansive as to be almost useless to anyone with the exception of an instructional designer.  I struggle to imagine a situation where I would use these rubrics to evaluate a course I was considering taking. It is possible that one could use this structure and simplify it to provide some essential components that can form a brief checklist if I was ever tasked with building a training or course.
