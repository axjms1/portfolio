This artifact is the final evaluation report I completed in EDTECH 505. It evaluates a content management system called [Thrillshare](https://thrillshare.com/) that is used by many school districts across the country. I used this platform in my former position as an IT administrator so I had some familiarity with the product.  A former colleague is currently using the platform in their new position at [Wilder School District](https://www.wilderschools.org/) and often reaches out for assistance so it was a great opportunity to perform an evaluation of the product as well as to assess how well the school district was utilizing the platform. It was my hope that the work done in this evaluation would inform the stakeholders at the school district how to use the website and their online presence more effectively.

This project gave me some exposure to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) which is an incredibly powerful tool to measure the effectiveness of a website. However, the most applicable lesson from this artifact and the entire course was understanding the discipline that should be applied to evaluation.  Too often, I would omit a careful examination of a product or process and move directly to comparing possible options.  There is a place for a rapid decision based on comparisons of features alone but there is real value in going through the process of defining goals, identifying inputs, and measuring outputs.  This is especially true when evaluating an existing product or program.
