I created this logic model in EDTECH 505 using [Lucid](https://lucid.app/).  Completing this artifact early in the course provided the essential framework and guided the evaluation process of [Thrillshare](https://thrillshare.com/). I felt this artifact should be featured because it clearly and succinctly presents the elements of the entire formal evaluation process.  I plan to use this format or something similar to it in professional proposals for new projects or in presentations that evaluate existing projects.
