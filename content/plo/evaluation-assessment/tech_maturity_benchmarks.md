This artifact represents my first foray into the formal evaluation and assessment process and was completed in EDTECH 501.  Although it is anonymized it is a very real evaluation of the school where I was working at the time. The structure provided by the survey enabled a thorough and effective evaluation of the technology processes employed at the school and due to my position there, I was able to effect real change based on the conclusions of this summary.
