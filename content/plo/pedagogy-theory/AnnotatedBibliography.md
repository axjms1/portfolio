At the very beginning of the program, we were tasked with authoring an annotated bibliography on a topic of our choice. I was immediately drawn to the topic of Computational Thinking and how the approach can be applied to aid learning. This artifact focuses on the near, far, and overall transfer effects of instruction in computational thinking. In other words, it focused on studies that examined if instruction in computational thinking positively impacts topics beyond computer science and mathematics.
