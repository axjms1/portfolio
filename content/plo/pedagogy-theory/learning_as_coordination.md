In EDTECH 504 I was introduced to the theoretical foundations of educational technology which was yet another entirely new realm of study for me.  The essence of these theories are an examination of how people learn and the insights gleaned from them can apply to education of others or yourself. I chose to focus on the latter and found this course incredibly useful. No matter what your professional practice is learning how to learn is an essential skill.

This chapter review examines the pitfalls of over categorization as a mindset and how false dichotomies are prevalent in education specifically regarding Bloom's Taxonomy.  The intersection of neuroscience, cognitive psychology and education made for an interesting review and an excellent start to critical thinking regarding learning theories.
