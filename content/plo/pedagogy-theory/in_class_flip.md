In EDTECH 501 I developed this presentation to examine the pedagogical approach known as the "In Class Flip".  Using this approach educators provide the instruction before class remotely and use class time to work on "homework" or activities. In theory, this provides students with more control over the learning process.  This presentation is directed to a hypothetical school that is transitioning to a 1:1 device model for the first time.

The presentation linked below is designed to be done in person or over video conference but if you open the speaker notes you can follow along better. Unfortunately, this artifact has little to do with my professional practice past or present but I enjoyed learning about the topic.
