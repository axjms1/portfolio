The final project in EDTECH 504 was the reflection paper which was expected to be written to high standards.  Being new to learning theories I was less inclined to focus on one particular theory and examine its intricacies. Alternatively, I authored this paper as a broad survey of several learning theories and connected each, in turn, to artificial intelligence which is a topic of personal and professional interest.  

This artifact directly informs my professional practice in that understanding more clearly how people learn and by extension how I learn is simply essential.  The connection to any professional practice should be self-evident.  Ironically, the inclusion of artificial intelligence did not inform my professional practice as well.  Learning more about the history of Skinner's machines and the history of AI was enjoyable but not directly applicable to my work.
