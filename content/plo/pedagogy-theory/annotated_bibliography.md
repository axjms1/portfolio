At the very beginning of the program, in EDTECH 501, we were tasked with completing an annotated bibliography on a topic of our choice. I was immediately drawn to the topic of Computational Thinking and how the approach can be applied to aid learning. This artifact focuses on the near, far, and overall transfer effects of instruction in computational thinking. In other words, it focused on studies that examined if instruction in computational thinking positively impacts topics beyond computer science and mathematics.

Transference is an interesting topic and merits further examination but the elements of computational thinking itself i.e. decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking are incredibly useful in my current professional practice.  The bulk of my time is spent thinking in this fashion and applying that framework to whatever project I am currently tasked with.  Completing this artifact and having these simple steps at the forefront of my mind makes me more capable in my role as a test engineer.
