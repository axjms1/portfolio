I was immediately drawn to the topic of Computational Thinking and how the approach can be applied to aid learning. This artifact focuses on the near, far, and overall transfer effects of instruction in computational thinking. In other words, it focused on studies that examined if instruction in computational thinking positively impacts topics beyond computer science and mathematics.</p>

Greater autonomy is a wonderful feature of charter schools but that autonomy should not be used to compromise ethical standards or violate school policy.  In this animation, I examine how the temptation to violate technology purchasing policies for friends at work can quickly lead to ethics violations.</p>

This artifact was developed to leverage technology to help school leaders ensure their online presence meets all applicable legal requirements.  This can be a complicated task, especially in a small charter school setting with limited resources and expertise.  This self-assessment to be completed by school or IT administrators identified all essential components of a website including legal disclosures and policies at the time it was published.</p>

Although it is anonymized it is a very real evaluation of the school where I was working at the time. The structure provided by the survey enabled a thorough and effective evaluation of the technology processes employed at the school and due to my position there, I was able to effect real change based on the conclusions of this summary.</p>
